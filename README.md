# Triple Town
Console-based version of [`TripleTown`](http://spryfox.com/our-games/tripletown/)

# Caveat emptor
This is an abridged version and is missing key features like bears and scoring. PRs welcome :]

# Demo
```bash
Got: Tree
Please enter a position between (1,1) to (6,6) (i.e. (1,2)) to place piece on board
